I encountered the same issue, but I managed to resolve it. Here's how I tackled it:

The directory structure of my worktree is as follows:

```
.vscode
└── settings.json
src
└── challenges
    └── some modules...
    lib.rs
    main.rs
Cargo.lock
Cargo.toml
```

Within the `.vscode` folder, there is a `settings.json` file that contains the following data:

```json
{
  "rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [
    "./challenges/Cargo.toml"
  ]
}
```

As you can observe, I don't have a `./challenges/Cargo.toml` file because I initially created that folder as a library using `cargo new --lib and later deleted it. This is why the incorrect path exists.

To resolve the issue, I simply modified the configuration to make rust-analyzer work again:

```json
{
  "rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [
    "./Cargo.toml"
  ]
}
```
